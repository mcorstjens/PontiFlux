# About PontiFlux
PontiFlux is an installation that visualises the Pope's twitterfeed in the real world. Whenever the Pope sends out a new Tweet, PontiFlux wil trigger a electro circuit (Arduino) which turns on a bright light in the shape of a latin cross. Taking "Christ shall give thee light" quite literally.
