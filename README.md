# PontiFlux
PontiFlux is an installation that visualises the Pope's twitterfeed in the real world. Whenever the Pope sends out a new Tweet, PontiFlux wil trigger a electro circuit (Arduino) which turns on a bright light in the shape of a latin cross. Taking "Christ shall give thee light" quite literally. This repository will give you an insight in the Arduino and Web code of the project.
